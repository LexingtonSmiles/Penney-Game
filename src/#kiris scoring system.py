#kiris scoring system


#generate all the combinations of true and false when three are picked

#compare two combinations to see which win
#combinations cannot be the same for both players


#count the number of tricks won

#count the number of cards won



#initial ideas:
#- make a df with the combinations already stored then iterate by row to calculate the number of tricks and cards for each player
#- use arrays instead to hold the info
#- use a for loop to build the combinations instead of inserting myself
#- use another package to make the table like tabulate
#- make individual functions to calculate num of tricks or cards
#- use previously made variable to calculate num of tricks or cards
#- do i need to write the code to look into each file in the data folder then calculate?
#- how can i best present to overall findings?
#- need to make some kind of table, do i do this with df or tabulate or just normal npy file - this links back to the format of how we printed the info from all the different generate decks
