# Data Generation and Storage Assessment and Test 

We have three distinct comparisons we want to test for data generation or storage.
These include:
- the way we shuffle decks:
  - (a)generating random indices
    
    vs.
  - (b)kiri help
- detecing seed to use for deck generation:
  - (c)scanning each file in the data folder and returning the next highest integer
    
    vs
  - (d)storing a seed variable and updating with +1 each time a file is generated
  
- the storage of decks using:
  - (e)booleans
    
    vs
  - (f) 0s and 1s

permutation 1: is kiri's version (bdf)

permutation 2: lex's version (ace)

permutation 3: kiri's version with booleans (bde)

permutation 4: lex's version with 0s and 1s (acf)

permutation 5: 

permutation 6: 

permutation 7: 

permutation 8: 

permutation 9:
