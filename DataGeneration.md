# Data Generation and Storage Assessment and Test 

We have three distinct comparisons we want to test for data generation or storage.
These include the way we shuffle decks, for producing what seed to use for deck generation: scanning each file in the data folder and returning the next highest integer vs storing a seed variable and updating with +1 each time a file is generated, and the storage of booleans vs 0s and 1s

permutation 1: is kiri's version

permutation 2: lex's version

permutation 3: kiri's version with booleans

permutation 4: lex's version with 0s and 1s

permutation 5: 

permutation 6: 

permutation 7: 

permutation 8: 

permutation 9:
