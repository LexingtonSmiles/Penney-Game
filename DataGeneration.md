# Data Generation and Storage Assessment and Test 

We have three distinct comparisons we want to test for data generation or storage.
These include the way we shuffle decks, the way find/track seed usage, and the storage of booleans vs 0s and 1s

permutation 1: is kiri's version

permutation 2: lex's version

permutation 3: kiri's version with booleans

permutation 4: lex's version with 0s and 1s

permutation 5: 

permutation 6: 

permutation 7: 

permutation 8: 

permutation 9:
